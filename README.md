Opinionated implementation of Backbone with Browserify to create a scalable front-end application using Backbone JS, Underscore JS, Browserify and Bootstrap.
                                                                
## The Problem
Migrate my existent [backbone-amd](https://github.com/gvazq82/backbone-amd) project to Browserify.

## Requirements
This application will require to have node installed then please follow the below instructions to install it.

1. Install node and npm, see [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) for instructions.
2. Ensure that npm installs global packages to a directory with the proper permissions. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).
